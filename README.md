# Amazon-Suppression-Report

This script provides a GUI tool for exporting Amazon suppression reports, either weekly or monthly, using suppression files downloaded from Vendor Central. These suppression files are concatenated into a single file and aggregated within the desired period. The script uses the tkinter library to create a simple graphical interface for selecting either a monthly or weekly report.
